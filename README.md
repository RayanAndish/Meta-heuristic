# Metaheuristic Algorithms Benchmarking

This repository contains Python implementations of 7 metaheuristic algorithms (AHOA, AVOA, BESOA, BWOA, COA, HBM, TSOA) applied to 10 benchmark functions (Ackley, Bohachevski, Branin, Griewank, Michalewicz, Rastrigin, Rosenbrock, Schwefel, Sphere, Styblinski_Tang) across different iterations (30, 100, 1000, 10000, 25000). The results have been analyzed and provide insights into the performance of these algorithms on various problem domains.

## Algorithms

1. AHOA (Artificial Hunting Optimization Algorithm)
2. AVOA (Artificial Vegetative Optimization Algorithm)
3. BESOA (Binary Elephant Swarm Optimization Algorithm)
4. BWOA (Binary Whale Optimization Algorithm)
5. COA (Cheetah Optimization Algorithm)
6. HBM (Harmony Search with Big Bang Mutation)
7. TSOA (Tabu Search Optimization Algorithm)

## Benchmark Functions

1. Ackley
2. Bohachevski
3. Branin
4. Griewank
5. Michalewicz
6. Rastrigin
7. Rosenbrock
8. Schwefel
9. Sphere
10. Styblinski_Tang

## Usage
change the parameters for your desire Dimention and Iteration :
dim = 30
max_iter or iteration = 1000
lb and ub = (x,x) that x must defined from your Benchmark Function
I have created a separate file for each benchmark function with the normal parameters of that function

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: NumPy, Matplotlib, etc. (List dependencies and installation instructions)
